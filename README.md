GooFit is a massively-parallel framework, written in CUDA, for
doing maximum-likelihood fits with a comfortable syntax.
It is also possible to build
GooFit using OpenMP.

* [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
* [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [API documentation](https://GooFit.github.io/GooFit)

## Requirements

* If using CUDA:
 * CUDA 7.5 and 8.0 tested, older versions should work for now
 * An nVidia GPU supporting compute capability at least 2.0 (3.5 recommended)
* If using OpenMP:
 * A compiler supporting OpenMP and C++11 (GCC 4.8+ and Intel 17 tested)

## Getting the files

* Clone with git:
```
git clone git://github.com/goofit/goofit.git
cd goofit
```

If you want to live on the bleeding edge, or are interested in contributing to GooFit, checkout the dev branch:
```
git checkout dev
```


## Building 

The build system now uses CMake. The procedure is standard for CMake builds:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you want to change compiler, set `CC` and `CXX` to appropriate defaults *before* you run cmake either inline or in your environment. If you want to set the host and device backends, you can set those options. The defaults are:
```
cmake .. -DGOOFIT_DEVICE=CUDA -DGOOFIT_HOST=OMP
```

Valid options are `CUDA` (device only), `OMP`, `CPP`, and `TBB` (unavailable currently).

Other custom options supported along with the defaults:

* `-DGOOFIT_ARCH=Auto` (Auto, Common, All, valid number(s) or name(s)): sets the compute architecture. See [CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/module/FindCUDA.html).
* `-DGOOFIT_EXAMPLES=ON`: Build the examples
* `-DGOOFIT_PACKAGES=ON`: Build any packages found with the name `goofit*`
* `-DGOOFIT_SEPARATE_COMP=OFF`: Enable separable compilation of PDFs
* `-DGOOFIT_TESTS=OFF`: Build the goofit tests


A few standard cmake tricks:

* Use `VERBOSE=1` to see the commands used to build the files
* Use `-L` to list the CMake options
* Use `ccmake` if available to see a curses (terminal) gui, or `cmake-gui` for a completely graphical interface
* Use `-G` and the name of a generator to use something other than `make`, like `Xcode` or `Ninja`
* Open the `CMakeLists.txt` with QtCreator to generate for that IDE
* Set the release type with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `Debug`, etc.
* Set up multiple build directories, like `build-omp`
* CMake remembers your `-D` option selections in your build directory so you don't have to specify them again
* CMake reruns when needed when you `make`
* Use `-j12` to build with 12 cores (for example)
* Use `cmake --build .` to build without refering to your specific build tool, like `make`


> ## Classic Makefile system (depreciated)
>   
> * You should set `CUDALOCATION` for your system
> 
> * You should have run source `thisroot.sh` to setup ROOT paths and other environment variables
> 
> * Set `TARGET_OMP=1` if you want to use OMP
>   * Checkout a copy of CUDA's thrust next to the goofit repository (there's nothing to compile)
>   * If you already have thrust in a different location, set `THRUSTLOCATION`
> 
> ```
> make all TARGET_OMP=1
> ```
> 
> Following the fairly standard makefile convention, all programs are built in-place instead of in a build directory.

## Running the Examples

* To run all the examples, with timing information, use:
```
./examples/RunAll.py
```

(This requires the [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, install with `pip install plumbum`, `pip install --user plumbum`, or `conda -c conda-forge plumbum`.)

If you want to run an individual example, those are in subdirectories in examples (built products are in your build directory, the source is in `goofit/examples`).


## Adding a new example:

The examples are designed to be easy to add to. Make a new directory, then add a new CMakeLists.txt in your directory with one or more of the following two lines:

```
goofit_add_directory()
goofit_add_executible(MyNewExample MyNewExample.cu)
```

The first line adds your `.cu` file with goofit code as an executible, and the second one sets up a symbolic links to the source and datafiles in the build directory to the source directory. If you perfer to only have some files symbolically linked, use `goofit_add_link(filename.ext)` explicitly for each file. To get the example to build when you build goofit, add the name of your directory to `examples/CMakeLists.txt`.

If you are building with separable compilation, you can also use `goofit_add_pdf(mypdf.cu)` to add a PDF. This will also require that you include any directory that you need with `include_directory`, as usual.

> If you want to extend the Makefile system instead, copy a Makefile from a different directory, changing the relevent project name (only one program per directory supported), and make a new target in `examples/Makefile`. 

## Adding a new project
  
If you'd like to make a seperate goofit project, you can do so. Simply checkout your project inside goofit, with the name `work` or `goofit`+something. CMake will automatically pick up those directories and build them, and GooFit's git will ignore them. Otherwise, they act just like the example directory. If you add a new directory, you will need to explicitly rerun cmake, as that cannot be picked up by the makefile. The automatic search can be turned off with the `GOOFIT_PROJECTS` option.

## Converting from older GooFit code
 
The build system underwent a major upgrade in the move to CMake. The folders that were introduced to keep the includes structured require modifications of source code, converting lines like `#include "Variable.hh"` to `#include "goofit/Variable.h`. This modification can be done for you by running the provided script, `scripts/ModernizeGooFit.py` on your source files (requires Python and Plumbum). You should remove your old Makefiles and use the new `CMakeFiles.txt` files provided in examples - this should require
writing two lines of code instead of the 50 or so previously needed.
