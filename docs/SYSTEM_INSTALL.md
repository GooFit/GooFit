# Installing GooFit on different systems

The Docker command for each system is listed at the beginning of each command, to show setup from scratch. Ignore that line if you are not using Docker.

The following commands show you how to get a *minimal* install of GooFit on a vanilla system; you will probably want to add ROOT for your system, and possibly CUDA if you have a graphics card. If you do not have ROOT, some functionality, such as the Minuit1 version of the fitter, will not be available, and most of the examples will not be included in the build.

## CentOS 7

For simplicity, this uses EPEL to get access to `python-pip`, and uses the pip version of CMake. Feel free to download CMake directly from Kitware instead. You can also use this recipe with an [nvidia-docker CentOS image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/).

```bash
docker run -it centos
yum install epel-release -y
yum install python-pip git gcc-c++ make -y
pip install cmake plumbum
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
cd GooFit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
```

If you'd like to add ROOT, add the following lines before running CMake:

```bash
mkdir root-6 && curl https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.08.06.Linux-centos7-x86_64-gcc4.8.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C root-6
source root-6/bin/thisroot.sh
```

## Alpine Linux 3.5

A truly minimal system, Alpine gives you a working Docker system under 3 MB.

```bash
docker run -it alpine
apk add --no-cache make cmake g++ git libexecinfo-dev
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
cd GooFit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest
```

In the spirit of minimality, this is less instructive and contains more magic, but also would also work:

```bash
docker run -it alpine
apk add --no-cache make cmake g++ git
git clone https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
cd GooFit
make
```

If you'd like to use the Python version:

```bash
docker run -it alpine
apk add --no-cache python-dev cmake ninja g++ git libexecinfo-dev
python -m ensurepip
pip install scikit-build
pip -v install git+https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
```

## Ubuntu 16.04

Ubiquitous Ubuntu works also. Ubuntu was used for the NVidia docker solution due to better support from NVidia. The following example uses ninja-build instead of make, but make works if you perfer it. You should also be able to use this recipe with an [nvidia-docker Ubuntu image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/).

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git cmake ninja-build g++
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
cd GooFit
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest
```

If you'd like to add ROOT, add the following lines before running CMake:
```bash
mkdir root-6 && curl https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.08.06.Linux-ubuntu16-x86_64-gcc5.4.tar.gz | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C root-6
source root-6/bin/thisroot.sh
```

## OpenSUSE

If you use `make`, adding `-jN` where `N` is the number of cores will make builds much faster on multicore systems! `ninja` does this automatically.

```bash
docker run -it opensuse sh
zypper install -y git cmake gcc-c++
git clone --recursive https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
cd GooFit
make
```

### Adding ROOT:

As always, https://root.cern.ch/build-prerequisites#opensuse is a good resource, though `glu-devel` seems to now be required as well. I'm using `ninja` to build in parallel automatically (and it seems to be faster as well).

```bash
zypper install -y git bash cmake gcc-c++ gcc binutils xorg-x11-libX11-devel xorg-x11-libXpm-devel xorg-x11-devel xorg-x11-proto-devel xorg-x11-libXext-devel glu-devel
zypper install -y ninja tar
git clone --depth=1 --branch=v6-10-04 http://github.com/root-project/root.git root_git
mkdir root_build
cd root_build
cmake ../root_git -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/root-6-10-04
cmake --build . --target install
```

Then, you can activated that copy of root with:

```bash
source /opt/root-6-10-04/bin/thisroot.sh
```

You might want to add useful extra ROOT library: `-Droofit=ON -Dmathmore=ON -Dminuit2=ON`

## Note on CMake install

While other install methods for cmake, like `pip`, are easier, this way should always work. On Linux, you can manually get a version of CMake using:

```bash
mkdir cmake && wget -qO- "https://cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.1-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz" | tar --strip-components=1 -xz -C cmake
export PATH=`pwd`/cmake/bin:$PATH
```

The second line will need to be rerun whenever use a new shell. Feel free to make your updated CMake default; CMake is insanely backward compatible and will even "dumb itself down" when it sees a lower version in the `minimum_required` line in  `CMakeLists.txt`.
