The GooFit Framework {#mainpage}
================================

Introduction
============

[GooFit](https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit) (\ref footnote1 "1")
is a framework for creating arbitrary probability density
functions (PDFs) and evaluating them over large datasets using nVidia
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). New PDFs are written partly in
nVidia's CUDA programming language and partly in C++; however, no
expertise in CUDA is required to get started, because the
already-existing PDFs can be put together in plain C++.

Aside from the mass of unenlightened hominids who have not yet
discovered their need for a massively-parallel fitting framework, there
are three kinds of GooFit users:

-   Initiates, who write "user-level code" - that is, code which
    instantiates existing PDF classes in some combination. No knowledge
    of CUDA is required for this level. If your data can be described by
    a combination of not-too-esoteric functions, even if the combination
    is complicated, then user code is sufficient. Section
    [User code](@ref usercode) gives an example of how to write a simple fit.

-   Acolytes, or advanced users, who have grasped the art of creating
    new PDF classes. This involves some use of CUDA, but is mainly a
    question of understanding the variable-index organization that
    GooFit PDFs use. Section [New PDFs](@ref newpdfs) considers this organization
    in some depth.

-   Ascended Masters, or architects, who by extended meditation have
    acquired a full understanding of the core engine of GooFit, and can
    modify it to their desire (\ref footnote2 "2"). Section [Engine](@ref engine) gives a
    detailed narrative of the progress of a PDF evaluation through the
    engine core, thus elucidating its mysteries. It should only rarely
    be necessary to acquire this level of mastery; in principle only the
    developers of GooFit need to know its internal details.

Aside from considerations of the user's understanding, GooFit does
require a CUDA-capable graphics card to run on, with compute capability
at least 2.1. Further, you will need nVidia's CUDA SDK 7.0 or better, in particular
the `nvcc` compiler. Aside from this, GooFit is known to compile and run
on Fedora 14, Ubuntu 12.04, RHEL 6.9, RHEL 7.4, and OSX 10.8.4. It has been tested mostly on the
Tesla product line of Fermi, Kepler, and Pascal generations of nVidia GPUs.

Getting started
---------------

You will need to have a CUDA-capable device and to have the development
environment (also known as the software development kit or SDK) set up,
with access to the compiler `nvcc` and its libraries. If you have the
hardware, you can get the SDK from [nVidia's
website](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-computing-sdk).

With your CUDA environment set up, you can install GooFit thus:

-   Clone from the GitHub repository:

        git clone git://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git
        cd GooFit

-   Compile with `cmake`:

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make

    Do not be alarmed by warning
    messages saying that such-and-such a function's stack size could not
    be statically determined (currently hidden); this is an unavoidable (so far) side
    effect of the function-pointer implementation discussed in section
    [Engine](@ref engine).

-   Run the â€˜simpleFitExample' program, which generates
    three distributions, fits them, and plots the results:

        cd examples/simpleFit
        ./simpleFit

    The expected output is a MINUIT log for three different fits, and
    three image files.

-   Run the Dalitz-plot tutorial, which fits a text file
    containing toy Monte Carlo data to a coherent sum of Breit-Wigner
    resonances:

        cd examples/dalitz
        ./dalitz dalitz_toyMC_000.txt

Quick troubleshooting: GooFit uses [FindCUDA](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/module/FindCUDA.html), and expects
to find `root-config` in your path (ROOT optional, but used in most examples). Check the docs for FindCUDA if you need help locating your CUDA install.

The text file contains information about simulated decays of the \f$D^0\f$
particle to \f$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\f$; in particular, in each line, the second
and third numbers are the Dalitz-plot coordinates \f$m^2(pi^+\pi^0)\f$ and
\f$m^2(pi^-\pi^0)\f$. The `dalitz` program creates a PDF describing the
distribution of these two variables in terms of Breit-Wigner resonances,
reads the data, sends it to the GPU, and fits the PDF to the data - the
floating parameters are the complex coefficients of the resonances. The
expected output is a MINUIT fit log showing that the fit converged, with
such-and-such values for the real and imaginary parts of the resonance
coefficients.

User-level code {#usercode}
===============

From the outside, GooFit code should look like ordinary, object-oriented
C++ code: The CUDA parts are hidden away inside the engine, invisible to
the user. Thus, to construct a simple Gaussian fit, merely declare three
GooFit::Variable objects and a GooFit::GaussianPdf object that uses them, and create
an appropriate GooFit::UnbinnedDataSet to fit to:


Simple Gaussian fit {#listinggaussfit}
-------------------

```cpp
int main (int argc, char** argv) {

  // Optional, but highly recommended. Based loosely
  // on TApplication.
  GooFit::Application app {"Simple Gaussian Fit", argc, argv};

  // Run the application parser, setup MPI if
  // needed, and exit if parsing failed
  GOOFIT_PARSE(app);

  // Create an object to represent the observable,
  // the number we have measured. Give it a name,
  // upper and lower bounds, and a number of bins
  // to use in numerical integration.
  Observable xvar {"xvar", -5, 5};
  xvar.setNumBins(1000);

  // A data set to store our observations in.
  UnbinnedDataSet data {xvar};

  // "Observe" ten thousand events and add them
  // to the data set, throwing out any events outside
  // the allowed range. In a real fit this step would
  // involve reading a previously created file of data
  // from an _actual_ experiment.
  TRandom donram(42);
  for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
    fptype val = donram.Gaus(0.2, 1.1);
    if (fabs(val) > 5) {--i; continue;}
    data.addEvent(val);
  }

  // Variables to represent the mean and standard deviation
  // of the Gaussian PDF we're going to fit to the data.
  // They take a name, starting value, optional initial
  // step size and upper and lower bounds. Notice that
  // here only the mean is given a step size; the sigma
  // will use the default step of one-tenth of its range.
  Variable mean {"mean", 0, 1, -10, 10};
  Variable sigm {"sigm", 1, 0.5, 1.5};

  // The actual PDF. The Gaussian takes a name, an independent
  // (ie observed) variable, and a mean and width.
  GaussianPdf gauss {"gauss", xvar, mean, sigm};

  // Copy the data to the GPU.
  gauss.setData(&data);

  // A class that talks to MINUIT and GooFit. It needs
  // to know what PDF it should set up in MINUIT.
  FitManager fitter {&gauss};

  // The actual fit.
  fitter.fit();
  return 0;
}
```

Notice that, behind the scenes, GooFit assumes that there will be
exactly one top-level PDF and data set; it is not advised to break this
assumption unless you know what you are doing and exactly how you are
getting around it.

Data sets
---------

To create a data set with several dimensions, supply a `vector` of
`Observable`s:

```cpp
Observable xvar {"xvar", -10, 10};
Observable yvar {"yvar", -10, 10};
vector<Observable> vars {xvar, yvar};
UnbinnedDataSet data(vars);
```

In this case, to fill the data set, set the GooFit::Variable values and call
the `addEvent` method without arguments:

```cpp
xvar.setValue(3);
yvar.setValue(-2);
data.addEvent();
```

This will add an event with the current values of the GooFit::Variable list to
the data set. In general, where an unknown number of arguments are
wanted, GooFit prefers to use a `vector` of pointers.

Fit types
---------

By default, GooFit will do an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit, where the
goodness-of-fit metric that is minimized (\ref footnote3 "3") is the negative sum of
logarithms of probabilities, which is equivalent to maximizing the joint
overall probability:
\f{align}{
\cal P &=& -2\sum\limits_{events} \log(P_i)
\f}
where \f$P_i\f$
is the PDF value for event \f$i\f$.

To get a binned fit, you should create a GooFit::BinnedDataSet instead of the
GooFit::UnbinnedDataSet; the procedure is otherwise the same. Notice that the
GooFit::BinnedDataSet will use the number of bins that its constituent
GooFit::Variables have at the moment of its creation. Supplying a
GooFit::BinnedDataSet to a GooFit::GooPdf (which is the base class of all the
`FooPdf` classes such as `GaussianPdf`) will, by default, make it do a
binned negative-log-likelihood fit, in which the goodness-of-fit
criterion is the sum of the logarithms of the Poisson probability of
each bin:
\f{align}{
{\cal P} &=& -2*\sum\limits_{bins}(N * \log(E) - E)
\f}
where
\f$E\f$ is the expected number of events in a bin and \f$N\f$ is the observed
number.

There are two non-default variants of binned fits: A chisquare fit where
the error on a bin entry is taken as the square root of the number of
observed entries in it (or 1 if the bin is empty), and a "bin error" fit
where the error on each bin is supplied by the GooFit::BinnedDataSet. To do
such a fit, in addition to supplying the GooFit::BinnedDataSet (and providing
the errors through the `setBinError` method in the case of the bin error
fit), you should create a suitable `FitControl` object and send it to
the top-level GooFit::GooPdf:

```cpp
Variable decayTime {"decayTime", 100, 0, 10};
BinnedDataSet* ratioData {&decayTime};
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
  ratioData.SetBinContent(getRatio(i));
  ratioData.SetBinError(getError(i));
}

vector<Variable*> weights;
weights.push_back(new Variable("constaCoef", 0.03, 0.01, -1, 1));
weights.push_back(new Variable("linearCoef", 0, 0.01, -1, 1));
weights.push_back(new Variable("secondCoef", 0, 0.01, -1, 1));

PolynomialPdf poly {"poly", decayTime, weights};
poly.setFitControl(new BinnedErrorFit());
poly.setData(&ratioData);
```

The `FitControl` classes are `UnbinnedNLLFit` (the default),
`BinnedNLLFit` (the default for binned fits), `BinnedErrorFit` and
`BinnedChisqFit`.

Creating new PDF classes {#newpdfs}
========================

The simplest way to create a new PDF is to take the existing
GooFit::GaussianPdf class as a template. It is recommended that the user place
the `Foo` Pdf under the respective basic, combine, or physics directories.  Once placed,
cmake will appropriately find and compile the PDF.  However, a certain
amount of boilerplate is necessary to make the PDF actually work. First
of all, it needs a device-side function with a particular signature:


Signature of evaluation functions. {#listingfsign}
-------------------------------------------

```cpp
__device__ fptype device_Gaussian (fptype* evt,
                                   ParameterContainer &pc);
```

Notice that this is a standalone function, not part of any class; `nvcc`
does not play entirely nicely with device-side polymorphism, which is
why we organize the code using a table of function pointers - a poor
man's implementation of the virtual-function lookups built into C++.
Second, we need a pointer to the evaluation function:

```cpp
__device__ device_function_ptr ptr_to_Gaussian = device_Gaussian;
```

where `device_function_ptr` is defined (using `typedef`) as a pointer to
a function with the signature shown in the listing [here](@ref listingfsign):

```cpp
typedef fptype (*device_function_ptr) (fptype*,
                                       ParameterContainer &pc);
```

This pointer (\ref footnote4 "4") will be copied into the `d_function_table` array,
and its index in that array is the PDF's internal representation of "my
evaluation function".

Finally, the new PDF needs a bog-standard C++ class definition,
extending the GooFit::GooPdf superclass, which will allow it to be
instantiated and passed around in user-level code. [The indices section](@ref subindexarray)
discusses what should happen in the constructor;
otherwise the class may have any supporting paraphernalia that are
necessary or useful to its evaluation - caches, lists of components,
pointers to device-side constants, whatever.

The indices array {#subindexarray}
-----------------

The heart of a PDF's organization is its index array, which appears in
the arguments to its device-side evaluation function as
`ParameterContainer &pc`. The `ParameterContainer` contains pointers to
arrays containing PDF specific information.  This allows for different PDFs to share
the same parameters, as in two Gaussians with a common mean. It also stores the position of the event variables,
sometimes called observables, within the event array passed to the
evaluation function; this is the argument `fptype* evt`. The ParameterContainer also contains
any constants and normalization factors used within the PDF's normalization or evaluation.

Since each class will contain its 4 arrays of information, these arrays are populated by the
constructor of a PDF class; in particular, the constructor should call `registerParameter`
to add a given `Variable` that will be tracked by MINUIT and update the current value.  Internally, these numbers are stored in a
`vector<Variable>` (called `parametersList`). The `registerParameter` function will return the
index, which can be used for debugging purposes as the index returned will be the same index
used in the device function to acquire the same value.  The PDF constructor
should also call `registerObservable` on each of the event variables it depends on.

The method used for the indices arrays favors using more memory to have more memory-coherent reads. GooFit v2.1 and below favored
re-using memory as much as possible, which requires a larger amount of reads.  This method is used to provide better GPU
performance.

The `initialize` method configures the PDF to use a negative log-likelihood
fit if no fit is provided, and will configure the global metric taker to use this type of fit for the
given PDF.  The `initialize` method will also help the system determine the number of values used for the given fit.

An example may be useful at this point. Consider the simple Gaussian PDF
constructor:

```cpp
GaussianPdf::GaussianPdf (std::string name,
                          Observable _x,
                          Variable mean,
                          Variable sigma)
  : GooPdf(name, _x, mean, sigma) {
  registerFunction("ptr_to_Gaussian", ptr_to_Gaussian);
  initialize();
}
```

This is almost the simplest possible PDF: Two parameters, one
observable, no messing about! Notice that the call to
`registerFunction` sets the CUDA function this PDF is tied to.
You can simply pass as many GooFit::Observable and GooFit::Variable
parameters as you'd like to the parent constructor, or you can use
`registerObservable` and `registerParameter` yourself.  Take head the order that
in which the items are passed, as that is the order in which they will be interpreted by
the indexing system.

The ParameterContainer for the example Gaussian PDF contains five arrays; assuming it is the only
PDF in the system, looks like this:

    ParameterContainer
	functions           0
    parameters          2 3 4
    constants           0
	observableId's      1 0
	normalizations      1 0

'Functions' contains only one item, which is the pointer to our `ptr_to_Gaussian` function.
Second, the parameters list contains two items, which you can find at array position 0. These two values
are for our mean and sigma, in this case mean is 3 and sigma is 4. The gaussian PDF does not contain
constants, so the 0 position of the constants array contains the value 0. One Observable is used for
the gaussian pdf, which will contain the index into our `evt` array.  Finally,
the normalization values are given last, which has one normalization and the value is 0.

Now we can consider how the device-side code makes use of this ParameterContainer in the following
device function code for the gaussian PDF:

```cpp
__device__ fptype device_Gaussian (fptype* evt,
                                   ParameterContainer &pc) {
  fptype x = evt[pc.getObservable(0)];
  fptype mean = pc.getParameter(0);
  fptype sigma = pc.getParameter(1);
  pc.incrementIndex(1, 2, 0, 1, 1);

  fptype ret = exp(-0.5*(x-mean)*(x-mean)/(sigma*sigma));
  return ret;
}
```

The calculation of the Gaussian is straightforward enough, but let's
look at where the numbers `mean, sigma` and especially `x` come from.
The function is passed a pointer to the particular event array it is to
calculate the value for called `evt` and the ParameterContainer `pc` which
contains all 5 separate arrays for access. The benefit of using this container
structure is that the index returned by the constructor will be the same index
used to access the value in the device function.  This means that in order to
get the observable index, the function `pc.getObservable(0)` will add a `+1` to the
end, thus hiding unnecessary numerical counting on the developer.

Same goes for accessing the parameters. The mean is accessed with `pc.getParameter(0)`,
but internally it is looking at the parameters[0 + 1] and returning that value, which
is 3.

If we look at the expanded constructor:
```cpp
GaussianPdf::GaussianPdf (std::string name,
                          Observable _x,
                          Variable mean,
                          Variable sigma)
  : GooPdf(name) {
  int idx_o_0 = registerObservable(_x);
  int idx_p_0 = registerParameter(mean);
  int idx_p_1 = registerParameter(sigma);
  registerFunction("ptr_to_Gaussian", ptr_to_Gaussian);
  initialize();
}
```

the `idx_o_0` will be 0, which is the correct value we want to pass to the `pc.getObservable`
function to retrieve this PDF's observable value.  The same applies with the parameters, so
idx_p_0 is the index, which will be 0; idx_p_1 will be 1. If we looked up these values:

mean = parameters[idx_p_0 + 1];
sigma = parameters[idx_p_1 + 1];

We will get the appropriate values of mean = 3 and sigma = 4.

Constants
---------

There are two ways of storing constants, or three if we count
registering a GooFit::Variable as a parameter and telling MINUIT to keep it
fixed. Currently, no difference is made between an integer and floating constant. This is
potential room for optimization but differentiating, but currently is not done at this time.

Registering a constant can be used for any purpose - the maximum degree of a
polynomial, flagging the use of an optional parameter, or anything else
you can think of as long as the value is converted appropriately.  To register a constant, simply
call `registerConstant` with the value you wish to use within the device function.

```cpp
__host__ GaussianPdf::GaussianPdf (std::string n,
                                   Variable* _x,
                                   Variable* mean,
                                   Variable* sigma)
  : GooPdf(_x, n)
{
  registerParameter(mean));
  registerParameter(sigma));

  registerConstant(1.23);

  registerFunction("ptr_to_Gaussian", ptr_to_Gaussian);
  initialize();
}
```

This registers the integer as a floating point value 1.0 that can be queried by the device function
using `pc.getConstant(0)`. If I had registered two constants instead of one, the second one would
be looked up by `pc.getConstant(1)`. Remember, the `pc` is per PDF, so all values
are passed to the ParameterContainer structure in the order they were added.  If
any problems arise creating a new PDF, it is best to print out all values that are
registered and compare those values to the device functions.

```cpp
__device__ fptype device_Gaussian (fptype* evt,
                                   ParameterContainer &pc) {
  fptype x = evt[pc.getObservable(0)];
  fptype mean = pc.getParameter(0);
  fptype sigma = pc.getParameter(1);
  fptype sqrt_2pi = pc.getConstant(0);
  pc.incrementIndex(1, 2, 0, 1, 1);

  fptype ret = exp(-0.5*(x-mean)*(x-mean)/(sigma*sigma));
  ret /= sqrt_2pi;
  return ret;
}
```

A second method is to create a Variable through MINUIT as a fixed parameter.  This may not be
the best way to organize constants however, as this will add more memory that needs to be updated and
transferred each iteration even though the value is constant. Please refer to (#setIndices) for more
information on what is happening.

The third option requires a significant amount of expertise with CUDA and constant memory, thus only recommend
for architects.  With this method, we are going to bypass the ParameterContainer structure. For example,
suppose I want to store \f$\sqrt{2\pi}\f$ as a constant for use in the Gaussian. Then I would modify the
constructor thus:

```cpp
__device__ constant fptype c_sqrt_2pi;

__device__ fptype device_Gaussian (fptype* evt,
                                   ParameterContainer &pc) {
  fptype x = evt[pc.getObservable(0)];
  fptype mean = pc.getParameter(0);
  fptype sigma = pc.getParameter(1);
  pc.incrementIndex(1, 2, 0, 1, 1);

  fptype ret = exp(-0.5*(x-mean)*(x-mean)/(sigma*sigma));
  ret /= c_sqrt_2pi;
  return ret;
}

__host__ GaussianPdf::GaussianPdf (std::string n,
                                   Variable* _x,
                                   Variable* mean,
                                   Variable* sigma)
  : GooPdf(_x, n)
{
  registerParameter(mean));
  registerParameter(sigma));

  fptype sqrt2pi = sqrt(2*M_PI);
  MEMCPY_TO_SYMBOL(c_sqrt_2pi, &sqrt2pi, sizeof(fptype), 0, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  registerFunction("ptr_to_Gaussian", ptr_to_Gaussian);
  initialize();
}
```

This provides a single location in which to get the value stored in `c_sqrt_2pi`, and share it.  This uses constant memory,
however this is a precious resource that should not be used illegitametly. One good example of proper use is the constant
`c_motherMass`, which is used by the Amp3Body and ResonancePdf. Instead of allocating 17 doubles for the Amp3Body and
the 16 ResonancePdf's, we can allocate one double for all 17 PDF accesses.  This also applies to `c_daug1Mass`, `c_daug2Mass`, and
`c_daug3Mass`.

Note that the variable `c_sqrt_2pi` is only exposed to the provided PDF and any other PDF
contained within the contained file. It will be up to the architect to add global constants
if it is determined to be optimal for performance. This provides a safe place to locate a
value that will be used frequently into a location that prioritizes multiple memory
accesses, and reduces memory and calls for the ParameterContainer.

Not everything should fit into constant memory, only *values that will be accessed frequently
many times* (\ref footnote9 "9").  One may wish to immediately add all of
the ParameterContainer as constant memory, however this will not be ideal: this causes
the GPU memory to thrash, constantly fetching from global memory because not all of the parameter
container will fit inside each GPU's L1 cache.

setIndices {#setIndices}
============

This function will configure the global structures that will be used when performing the fit.  First, it will call
the function `populateArrays` with itself, which involves adding the number Variables, and the values for each Variable
into the host_parameters array.  Observables, constants, and normalizations are done the exact same way.  Once complete,
it will add all component PDFs using the same `populateArrays` method.

After all PDFs have been added, the metric operation is added last (#listingmetrics) and overrides the `*logger` component
of the root PDF.

This function only needs to be called once per separate fit, which it is called automatically any time `setData` is called.
Each iteration that MINUIT updates, it will call `updateParameters` which will populate the values into all host_parameters,
then update device memory with the new values.

ParameterContainer increment {#incrementIndex}
============

The ParameterContainer contains pointers to all index information that will be used by all PDFs.
Some PDFs will call other PDFs, thus a method for going to the next PDF is required for the ParameterContainer.  This method is called `incrementIndex`.  There are two
implementations for this function, one is a fast method that PDF developers should always try to use, and
the second is a slow method for when it is impossible to know consecutive PDF's and their structure.
When a user calls any function in which to return parameters, observable indices, constants, etc. it is
important to note that information is provided for the *current* PDF only. Once we call incrementIndex,
we have told the container that the fetching current function's values is complete, update all internal
counters to point to the next PDF.

First lets look at the fast method of incrementIndex

```cpp
void incrementIndex(const int funcs, const int parms, const int cons, const int obs, const int norms);
```

This function allows us to increment the counters based on the knowledge about the PDF. Unless there
is a conditional, all of this information should be known at compile-time with a few exceptions.
This method is preferred because it doesn't require any memory lookups to proceed; simply incrementing
internal counters by the provided numerical values that are passed to the `incrementIndex` will point
to the next function.

Sometimes it is impossible to know totals until runtime; in that situation, it is much better to read
the total number than call the slow version.  As an example, Dalitz PDF showcases both situations.
Take a look at the following device function:

```cpp
__device__ fptype device_DalitzPlot(fptype *evt, ParameterContainer &pc) {
    int num_obs = pc.getNumObservables();
    int id_m12  = pc.getObservable(0);
    int id_m13  = pc.getObservable(1);
    int id_num  = pc.getObservable(2);

    fptype m12 = evt[id_m12];
    fptype m13 = evt[id_m13];

    unsigned int numResonances = pc.getConstant(0);
    unsigned int cacheToUse    = pc.getConstant(1);

    if(!inDalitz(m12, m13, c_motherMass, c_daug1Mass, c_daug2Mass, c_daug3Mass)) {
        pc.incrementIndex(1, numResonances * 2, 2, num_obs, 1);

        // loop over resonances and efficiency functions
        for(int i = 0; i < numResonances; i++)
            pc.incrementIndex();

        // increment the efficiency function
        pc.incrementIndex();
        return 0;
    }

	fptype evtIndex = evt[id_num];

    auto evtNum = static_cast<int>(floor(0.5 + evtIndex));

    fpcomplex totalAmp(0, 0);

    for(int i = 0; i < numResonances; ++i) {
        fpcomplex amp = fpcomplex(pc.getParameter(i * 2), pc.getParameter(i * 2 + 1));

        fpcomplex me = RO_CACHE(cResonances[i][evtNum]);

        totalAmp += amp * me;
    }

    fptype ret = thrust::norm(totalAmp);
    pc.incrementIndex(1, numResonances * 2, 2, num_obs, 1);

    // loop to efficiency idx
    for(int i = 0; i < numResonances; i++)
        pc.incrementIndex();

    fptype eff = callFunction(evt, pc);
    ret *= eff;

    return ret;
}
```

First thing to note is grabbing the number of resonances, which for this PDF is the first
constant in the constant array `pc.getConstant(0);`.  We don't specifically know the number
of observables that were passed, but we can ask the `pc` object to give us the total
amount with `pc.getNumObservables()` since it is stored in the constant array; then hold on to this value
for when we call incrementIndex. If possible, it is best to re-use information rather than fetch;
it is expensive to fetch values from the ParameterContainer.

When looping over the resonances PDFs, please note that we can't use the fast incrementIndex version.
Some resonancePDF's take different inputs to `incrementIndex` so we can't used a fixed values.
The slow version of incrementIndex will look up the total value for the given PDF, and increment by
that amount, thus requiring 4x memory lookups in order to proceed.

Program flow {#engine}
============

This section narrates the course of a fit after it is created, passing
through MINUIT and the core GooFit engine. In particular, we will
consider the example Gaussian fit shown in listing [Gauss fit](@ref listinggaussfit)
and look at what happens in these innocent-looking lines:

## Data transfer and fit invocation {#listingactualfit}

```cpp
gauss.setData(&data);
FitManager fitter(&gauss);
fitter.fit();
```

Copying data
------------

The `setData` method will setup all indexing buffers for the root PDF, and also copy the contents of the supplied GooFit::DataSet to
the GPU:

Internals of the setData method {#listingsetData}
--------------------------------------------------

```cpp
setIndices();
int dimensions = observables.size();
numEntries = data->getNumEvents();
numEvents = numEntries;

fptype* host_array = new fptype[numEntries*dimensions];
for (int i = 0; i < numEntries; ++i) {
  for (obsIter v = obsBegin(); v != obsEnd(); ++v) {
    fptype currVal = data->getValue((*v), i);
    host_array[i*dimensions + (*v)->index] = currVal;
  }
}

gooMalloc((void**) &dev_event_array, dimensions*numEntries*sizeof(fptype));
cudaMemcpy(dev_event_array, host_array, dimensions*numEntries*sizeof(fptype), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
delete[] host_array;
```

Notice the call to `setIndices`; this is where the indices of
observables passed to the PDF are decided and copied into the indices
array(#setIndices). This step cannot be done before all the subcomponents of the PDF
have had a chance to register their observables. Hence `setData` should
be called only after the creation of all PDF components, and only on the
top-level PDF.

The array thus created has the simple structure
`x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... xN yN zN`, that is, the events are laid out
contiguously in memory, each event consisting simply of the observables,
in the same order every time. Notice that if the GooFit::DataSet contains
GooFit::Variables that have not been registered as observables, they are
ignored. If `setData` is called with an GooFit::BinnedDataSet object, the
procedure is similar except that each â€˜event' consists of the
coordinates of the bin center, the number of events in the bin, and
either the bin error or the bin size. We will see later how the engine
uses the `dev_event_array` either as a list of events or a list of bins.

MINUIT setup
------------

Having copied the data to the GPU, the next task is to create the MINUIT
object that will do the actual fit; this is done by creating a
GooFit::FitManager object, with the top-level PDF as its argument, and calling
its `fit` method. The `fit` method does two things: First it calls the
`getParameters` method of the supplied PDF, which recursively gets the
registered parameters of all the component PDFs, and from the resulting
list of GooFit::Variables it creates MINUIT parameters by calling
`DefineParameter`. Second, it sets the method `FitFun` to be MINUIT's
function-to-minimize, and calls MINUIT's `mnmigr` method.

A few variants on the above procedure exist. Most obviously, ROOT
contains three implementations of the MINUIT algorithm, named `TMinuit`,
`TMinuit2`, and `TVirtualFitter` (\ref footnote5 "5"). GooFit provides the
first two methods, and defaults to GooFit::FitManagerMinuit2. The interfaces
differ, but the essential procedure is the one described above: Define parameters, set function-to-minimize, run
MIGRAD. (NB: As of v0.2, GooFit has not recently been tested with
`MINUIT_VERSION` set to 2 or 3.) In the case of `TMinuit`, one can call
`setMaxCalls` to override the usual MINUIT limitation on the number of
iterations, although my experience is that this is not usually helpful
because running into the iteration limit tends to indicate a deeper
problem with the fit. Finally, the underlying `TMinuit` object is
available through the `getMinuitObject` method, allowing fine-grained
control of what MINUIT does, for example by calling `mnhess` in place of
`mnmigr`.

PDF evaluation
--------------

We have copied the data to the GPU, set up MINUIT, and invoked `mnmigr`.
Program flow now passes to MINUIT, which for purposes of this
documentation is a black box, for some time; it returns to GooFit by
calling the `FitFun` method with a list of parameters for which MINUIT
would like us to evaluate the NLL. `FitFun` translates MINUIT indices
into GooFit indices, and calls `copyParams()`, which eponymously copies
the value of each Variable, then updates the d_parameters with the newest
value. `FitFun` then returns the value from `GooPdf::calculateNLL` to
MINUIT, which absorbs the number into its inner workings and eventually
comes back with another set of parameters to be evaluated. Control
continues to pass back and forth in this way until MINUIT converges or
gives up, or until GooFit crashes.

The `calculateNLL` method does two things: First it calls the
`normalize` function of the PDF, which in turn will usually recursively
normalize the components; the results of the `normalize` call are copied
into the `d_normalizations` array on the GPU. Next it calls
`sumOfNll` and returns the resulting value. Particular PDF
implementations may override `sumOfNll`; most notably `AddPdf` does so
in order to have the option of returning an â€˜extended' likelihood, with
a term for the Poisson probability of the observed number of events in
addition to the event probabilities.

The `normalize` method, by default, simply evaluates the PDF at a grid
of points, returning the sum of all the values multiplied by the grid
fineness - a primitive algorithm for numerical integration, but one
which takes advantage of the GPU's massive parallelization. The fineness
of the grid usually depends on the `getNumBins` member of the observables;
in the case of the example Gaussian fit in listing [Gauss fit](@ref listinggaussfit),
the PDF will be evaluated at 1000 points, evenly spaced between -5 and 5.
However, this behavior can be overridden by calling the
`setIntegrationFineness` method of the PDF object, in which case the
number of bins (in each observable) will be equal to the supplied
fineness.

Stripped of complications, the essential part of the `normalize`
function is a call to `transform_reduce`:

normalization code. {#listingnormalization}
------------------------------------------

```cpp
fptype dummy = 0;
static plus<fptype> cudaPlus;
constant_iterator<fptype*> arrayAddress(normRanges);
constant_iterator<int> eventSize(observables.size());
counting_iterator<int> binIndex(0);

fptype sum = transform_reduce(make_zip_iterator(
                               make_tuple(binIndex,
                                          eventSize,
                                          arrayAddress)),
                              make_zip_iterator(
                               make_tuple(binIndex + totalBins,
                                          eventSize,
                                          arrayAddress)),
              *logger, dummy, cudaPlus);
```

Here `normRanges` is an array of triplets `lower, upper, bins` for each
observable, created by the `generateNormRanges` method. The member
`logger` points to an instance of the `MetricTaker` class, which has an
operator method that Thrust will invoke on each bin index between the
initial value of zero and the final value of `totalBins-1`. This
operator method, which is invoked once per thread with a separate
(global) bin number for each invocation, calculates the bin center and
returns the value of the PDF at that point. The `dummy` and `cudaPlus`
variables merely indicate that Thrust should add (rather than, say,
multiply) all the returned values, and that it should start the sum at
zero. The `normalization` method returns this sum, but stores its
inverse in the `host_normalization` array that will eventually be copied
to `d_normalizations` on the GPU; this is to allow the
micro-optimization of multiplying by the inverse rather than dividing in
every thread.

PDF implementations may override the `normalization` method, and among
the default PDFs, both `AddPdf` and `ProdPdf` do so to ensure that their
components are correctly normalized. Among the more specialized
implementations, `Amp3Body_TD` overrides `normalize` so that it may cache
the slowly-changing Breit-Wigner calculations, and also because its time
dependence is analytically integrable and it is a good optimization to
do only the Dalitz-plot part numerically. This points to a more general
rule, that once a PDF depends on three or four observables, the
relatively primitive numerical integration outlined above may become
unmanageable because of the number of points it creates. Finally, note
that PDFs may, without overriding `normalize`, advertise an analytical
integral by overriding GooFit::GooPdf's `hasAnalyticIntegral` method to return
`true`, and then implementing an `integrate` method to be evaluated on
the CPU.

The `logger` object will appear again in the actual PDF evaluation,
performing a very similar function, so it is worth taking a moment to
consider in detail exactly what the `transform_reduce` call does. It is important
to call setFitControl prior to the `transform_reduce` call if any changes to
the type of fit are made! The first two parameters (involving `make_tuple` calls) define the range of
evaluation: In this case, global bins (\ref footnote6 "6") 0 through \f$N-1\f$. They also
specify which `operator` method of `MetricTaker` should be called: It is
the one which takes as arguments two integers (the bin index and event
size) and an `fptype` array (holding the `normRanges` values), in that
order. Conceptually, Thrust will create one thread for each unique value
of the iterator range thus created - that is, one per global bin - and
have each thread invoke the indicated `operator` method. As a matter of
organization on the physical chip, it is likely that Thrust will
actually create a thousand or so threads and have each thread evaluate
as many bins as needed; but at any rate, the
`operator(int, int, fptype*)` method will be called once per global bin.
The last two arguments indicate that the return value should be
calculated as the sum of the return values from each `operator`
invocation, and that the sum should start at zero. Finally, the
`*logger` argument indicates the specific `MetricTaker` object to use,
which is important because this is where the function-pointer and
parameter indices are stored.

The `operator` does two things: First it calculates the bin centers, in
each observable, of the global bin:

Bin-center calculation {#listingbincenter}
----------------------

```cpp
#define MAX_NUM_OBSERVABLES 10

...

	ParameterContainer pc;

	//Note this was using shared memory, however this is not ideal as this limits the numbers
	//of threads that can run due to the max shared memory size used.
	fptype events[MAX_NUM_OBSERVABLES];

	// To convert global bin number to (x,y,z...) coordinates:
	// For each dimension, take the mod with the number of bins
	// in that dimension. Then divide by the number of bins, in
	// effect collapsing so the grid has one fewer dimension.
	// Rinse and repeat.

	// before we start, we need to progress ourselves based on the function we need to run
	for(int i = 0; i < functionIdx; i++)
		pc.incrementIndex(); // need to use the slow version, since we are not starting from index 0.

	int id = pc.getObservable(0);

	for (int i = 0; i < evtSize; ++i) {
	  fptype lowerBound = thrust::get<2>(t)[3*i+0];
	  fptype upperBound = thrust::get<2>(t)[3*i+1];
	  int numBins    = (int) floor(thrust::get<2>(t)[3*i+2] + 0.5);
	  int localBin = binNumber % numBins;

	  fptype x = upperBound - lowerBound;
	  x /= numBins;
	  x *= (localBin + 0.5);
	  x += lowerBound;
	  binCenters[id + i] = x;
	  binNumber /= numBins;
	}
```

in the straightforward way, and stores the bin centers in a *fake
event*. Since events are just lists of observables, we will copy
the value of the event into a temporary container, look up the index-within-events of each
observable, and set the entries of the locally-owned part of
`binCenters` accordingly. This event is then sent to the PDF for
evaluation:

```cpp
fptype ret = callFunction(events, pc);
```

where `callFunction` is just a wrapper for looking up the function
referred to by `pc.functionIdx` and calling it with the right part of the
parameter array:


Code to call device-side PDF implementations (some lines broken up for clarity) {#listingcallfunction}
----------------------------------


```cpp
__device__ fptype callFunction (fptype* eventAddress,
                                ParameterContainer &pc) {
  void* rawPtr = d_function_table[functionIdx];
  device_function_ptr fcn;
  fcn = reinterpret_cast<device_function_ptr>(rawPtr);
  return (*fcn)(eventAddress, pc);
}
```

This, finally, is where the `__device__` function from the PDF
definitions in section [New PDFs](@ref newpdfs) is called; we have now connected
all this engine code with the evaluation code for the Gaussian,
Breit-Wigner, polynomial, sum of functions, or whatever calculation we
happen to be doing today.

Having found the integral of the PDF, either using fake events as
outlined above or with an analytic calculation, we are now ready to find
the actual NLL, or sum of chi-squares, or other goodness-of-fit metric,
using the actual, observed events that we copied across in `setData`.
The procedure is similar to that for the normalization:

Goodness-of-fit evaluation {#listingnlleval}
-----------------


```cpp
transform_reduce(make_zip_iterator(make_tuple(eventIndex,
                                              arrayAddress,
                                              eventSize)),
                 make_zip_iterator(make_tuple(eventIndex + numEntries,
                                              arrayAddress,
                                              eventSize)),
                 *logger, dummy, cudaPlus);
```

Here the `*logger`, `dummy`, and `cudaPlus` arguments are doing the same
jobs as before. The tuple arguments, however, differ: In particular,
they are now indicating the range 0 to \f$N-1\f$ in *events*, not bins, and
`arrayAddress` this time points to the array of events, not to a set of
normalization triplets from which bin centers can be calculated. Since
the order of the arguments differs - it is now `int, fptype*, int` - a
different `operator` method is called:

Main evaluation operator (some lines broken up for clarity) {#listingmaineval}
----------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
__device__ fptype MetricTaker::operator ()
  (thrust::tuple<int, fptype*, int> t) const {
  ParameterContainer pc;
  // Calculate event offset for this thread.
  int eventIndex = thrust::get<0>(t);
  int eventSize  = thrust::get<2>(t);
  fptype* eventAddress = thrust::get<1>(t);
  eventAddress += (eventIndex * abs(eventSize));

  // Causes stack size to be statically undeterminable.
  fptype ret = callFunction(eventAddress, pc);

  // Notice assumption here! For unbinned fits the
  // eventAddress pointer won't be used in the metric,
  // so it doesn't matter what it is. For binned fits it
  // is assumed that the structure of the event is
  // (obs1 obs2... binentry binvolume), so that the array
  // passed to the metric consists of (binentry binvolume).
  void* fcnAddr = d_function_table[metricIndex];
  device_metric_ptr fcnPtr;
  fcnPtr = reinterpret_cast<device_metric_ptr>(fcnAddr);
  eventAddress += abs(eventSize)-2;

  ret = (*fcnPtr)(ret, eventAddress, parameters);
  return ret;
}
```

Observe that, for binned events, `eventSize` is negative; in this case
the event array looks like `x1 y1 n1 v1 x2 y2 n2 v2 ... xN yN nN vN`
where `x` and `y` are bin centers, `n` is the number of entries, and `v`
is the bin volume or error. This does not matter for the PDF evaluation
invoked by `callFunction`, which will just get a pointer to the start of
the event and read off the bin centers as event variables; hence the
`abs(eventSize)` in the calculation of the event address allows binned
and unbinned PDFs to be treated the same. However, it very much does
matter for the goodness-of-fit metric. Suppose the fit is the default
NLL: Then all the operator needs to do at this point is take the
logarithm of what the PDF returned, multiply by -2, and be on its way.
But if it is a chi-square fit, then it must calculate the expected
number of hits in the bin, which depends on the PDF value, the bin
volume, and the total number of events (\ref footnote8 "8"), subtract the observed
number, square, and divide by the observed number. Hence there is a
second function-pointer lookup, but now the `void*` stored in
`d_function_table` is to be interpreted as a different kind of
function - a "take the metric" function rather than a "calculate the
PDF" function. The `metricIndex` member of `MetricTaker` is set by the
`FitControl` object of the PDF; it points to one of the `calculateFoo`
functions:

Metric-taking functions {#listingmetrics}
-----------------------

```cpp
__device__ fptype calculateEval (fptype rawPdf,
                                 fptype* evtVal,
                                 fptype norm) {
  // Just return the raw PDF value, for use
  // in (eg) normalization.
  return rawPdf;
}

__device__ fptype calculateNLL (fptype rawPdf,
                                fptype* evtVal,
                                fptype norm) {
  rawPdf *= norm;
  return rawPdf > 0 ? -log(rawPdf) : 0;
}

__device__ fptype calculateProb (fptype rawPdf,
                                 fptype* evtVal,
                                 fptype norm) {
  // Return probability, ie normalized PDF value.
  return rawPdf * norm;
}

__device__ fptype calculateBinAvg (fptype rawPdf,
                                   fptype* evtVal,
                                   fptype norm) {
  rawPdf *= norm;
  rawPdf *= evtVal[1]; // Bin volume
  // Log-likelihood of numEvents with expectation of exp
  // is (-exp + numEvents*ln(exp) - ln(numEvents!)).
  // The last is constant, so we drop it; and then multiply
  // by minus one to get the negative log-likelihood.
  if (rawPdf > 0) {
    fptype expEvents = c_totalEvents*rawPdf;
    return (expEvents - evtVal[0]*log(expEvents));
  }
  return 0;
}

__device__ fptype calculateBinWithError (fptype rawPdf,
                                 fptype* evtVal,
                                 unsigned int par) {
  // In this case interpret the rawPdf as just a number,
  // not a number of events. Do not divide by integral over
  // phase space, do not multiply by bin volume, and do not
  // collect 200 dollars. evtVal should have the structure
  // (bin entry, bin error).
  rawPdf -= evtVal[0]; // Subtract observed value.
  rawPdf /= evtVal[1]; // Divide by error.
  rawPdf *= rawPdf;
  return rawPdf;
}

__device__ fptype calculateChisq (fptype rawPdf,
                                  fptype* evtVal,
                                  fptype norm) {
  rawPdf *= norm;
  rawPdf *= evtVal[1]; // Bin volume

  fptype ret = pow(rawPdf * c_totalEvents - evtVal[0], 2);
  ret /= (evtVal[0] > 1 ? evtVal[0] : 1);
  return ret;
}
```

Notice that the normalization factor is looked up prior to the metric
functions, and the special cases when the PDF or the observed number of
events is zero.

It is worth noting that the PDF evaluation function may itself call
other functions, either using `callFunction` or manually casting a
function index into other kinds of functions, as in the metric
calculation of listing [Main Eval](@ref listingmaineval). For example, in
`Amp3Body`, each resonance may be parametrized by a relativistic
Breit-Wigner, a Gaussian, a Flatte function, or more esoteric forms; so
the main function is supplied with a list of function indices and
parameter indices for them, and interprets the `void` pointer from
`d_function_table` as a specialized function type taking
Dalitz-plot location (rather than a generic event) as its argument. More
prosaically, `AddPdf` simply carries a list of PDF function indices and
indices of weights to assign them, and invokes `callFunction` several
times, multiplying the results by its weight parameters and returning
the sum.

We have now calculated the function value that we ask MINUIT to
minimize, for a single set of parameters; this value is passed back to
MINUIT, which does its thing and comes up with another set of parameters
for us, completing the loop. Ends here the saga of the fit iteration;
you now know the entire essential functionality of GooFit's core engine.

Existing PDF classes
====================

The GooFit PDFs, like ancient Gaul, are roughly divisible into three:

-   Basic functions, written because they are (expected to be)
    frequently used, such as the Gaussian and polynomial PDFs.

-   Combiners, functions that take other functions as arguments and spit
    out some combination of the inputs, for example sums and products.

-   Specialized PDFs, written for the \f$D^0\to\pi\pi\pi^0\f$ mixing
    analysis that is the driving test case for GooFit's capabilities.

In the lists below, note that all the constructors take pointers to
GooFit::Variable objects; rather than repetitively repeat "GooFit::Variable pointer"
in a redundantly recurring manner, we just say GooFit::Variable. Additionally,
the first argument in every constructor is the name of the object being
created; again this is not mentioned in every item. By convention,
constructors take observables first, then parameters.

Basic PDFs
----------

Basic PDFs are relatively straightforward: They take one or more
observables and one or more parameters, and implement operations that
are in some sense â€˜atomic' - they do not combine several functions in
any way. Usually they have a reasonably well-known given name, for
example "the threshold function" or "a polynomial". The canonical
example is the Gaussian PDF.

- GooFit::ArgusPdf
- GooFit::BifurGaussPdf
- GooFit::BWPdf
- GooFit::CorrGaussianPdf
- GooFit::CrystalBallPdf
- GooFit::ExpGausPdf
- GooFit::ExpPdf

- GooFit::GaussianPdf
- GooFit::InterHistPdf
- GooFit::JohnsonSUPdf
- GooFit::KinLimitBWPdf
- GooFit::LandauPdf
- GooFit::NovosibirskPdf
- GooFit::PolynomialPdf
- GooFit::ScaledGaussianPdf
- GooFit::SmoothHistogramPdf
- GooFit::StepPdf
- GooFit::VoigtianPdf

-  GooFit::TrigThresholdPdf (was in physics)
-  GooFit::BinTransformPdf (was in combination)

Combination PDFs
----------------

These are the tools that allow GooFit to be more than a collection of
special cases. The most obvious example is a sum of PDFs - without a
class for this, you'd have to write a new PDF every time you added a
Gaussian to your fit.

- GooFit::AddPdf
- GooFit::CompositePdf
- GooFit::ConvolutionPdf
- GooFit::EventWeightedAddPdf
- GooFit::MappedPdf
- GooFit::ProdPdf

Specialized amplitude-analysis functions
----------------------------------------

These functions exist mainly for use in a specific physics analysis,
mixing in \f$D^0\to\pi\pi\pi^0\f$. Nonetheless, if you are doing a
Dalitz-plot analysis, you may find them, and conceivably even this
documentation, helpful.

-   GooFit::Amp3Body
-   GooFit::DalitzVetoPdf
-   GooFit::IncoherentSumPdf
-   GooFit::MixingTimeResolution (in `MixingTimeResolution.h`)
-   GooFit::ResonancePdf (subclasses not separately documented yet)
-   GooFit::Amp3Body_TD
-   GooFit::ThreeGaussResolution
-   GooFit::TruthResolution

    variables. In two dimensions, with three bins in each of \f$x\f$ and
    \f$y\f$, the global bin is given by \f$3b_y+b_x\f$, where \f$b_{x,y}\f$ is the
    bin number in \f$x\f$ or \f$y\f$ respectively, as shown here:

\f[
\begin{array}{l|ccc}
    2 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
    1 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
    \hline
      & 0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}
\f]
 where the leftmost column and bottom row indicate the
    \f$y\f$ and \f$x\f$ bin number.

\anchor footnote8 8: This is why `functorConstants[0]` is reserved for that value!

\anchor footnote9 9: It is important to first profile before experimenting with these
	cases. Constants used for a single PDF are not appropriate, constants such as mother/daughter radius/mass
	are very good uses as many PDFs need to look at those values and they never change throughout the duration
	of a given fit.
