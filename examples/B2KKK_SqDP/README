This is example test square Dalitz fit on B+->K- K+ K+ channel.

A simulation sample was generated using Laura++ ( example GenFit3K.cpp) and fitted with GooFit.

The model consists of phi(1020), F'2(1525) and Flat NonRes amplitudes.

The simulated resonances complex coefs are:

- c_phi = 1.0 + 0.i
- c_f2  = 0.  + 1.i
- c_nr  = 1.0 + 0.i
