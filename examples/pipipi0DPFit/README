This example is to perform a Dalitz-plot for $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$.
You need to make the current project with 

$ gmake mixfit

to get the executable file "mixfit". In the file "Makefile", please make sure that the environment variable CUDALOCATION points to your CUDA install and GOOFITDIR points to the base GooFit directory.
Also make sure that the directory ${GooFitPATH}/rootstuff is included in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the library libRootUtils.so can be properly loaded before running any fit.

Before running a Dalitz plot fit with command "mixfit" for the first time, 
a bunch of ascii files containing data events (beefy ones) or pdf descriptions need to be downloaded from the following URL:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9081146/alltxtfiles4pipipi0DPFit.tgz
(Size: ~50 MB, ~144 MB after unpacking)

You then need to unpack the downloaded tar ball file in the current "pipipi0DPFit" directory via:

$ tar zxvf alltxtfiles4pipipi0DPFit.tgz
bkg_2_pdf_sideband_6slices.txt
bkg_3_pdf.txt
bkg_4_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_2slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_3slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_4slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_5slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_6slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_7slices_pdf.txt
signal_sigma_8slices_pdf.txt

dataFiles/sideband1.txt
dataFiles/bkgDalitz_2.txt
dataFiles/efficiency_flat.txt
dataFiles/bkgDalitz_3.txt
dataFiles/sideband2.txt

For the executable "mixfit", it takes several command-line arguments, and will fail if the arguments are not properly given. Now only for the demonstration of  Dalitz plot fits, you just run:

$ ./mixfit 4 dataFiles/cocktail_pp_0.txt blindSeed=0

The first argument is 4, which calls for a "canonical" DP fit over the given "data" stored in "dataFiles/cocktail_pp_0.txt" as the third argument. The last argument is to disable the blinding of mixing parameters x and y which is only necessary for real data. The "data" in "dataFiles/cocktail_pp_0.txt" is completely from the simulation (MC cocktails of signals / different background sources). The included signals events are simulated with the input of x = y = +1%. The statistics of this sample is comparable to that of real data.
