    // coherent sum. The caching method requires that it be done this way or the ProdPdf
    // normalisation will get *really* confused and give wrong answers.

    // The mistag variable is the probability that an event has a mother particle
    // that was correctly reconstructed but wrongly tagged. Consider an analysis
    // with three components: Signal, mistagged signal, and background. We want to
    // have the PDF be a sum, thus:
    // P = p_s S(m+, m-) + p_m(l_f S(m+, m-) + (1 - l_f)S(m-, m+)) + p_B B(m+, m-)
    // where p_s, p_m, p_B are the respective probabilities that this event
    // are signal, mistagged, or background, and l_f is the "lucky fraction",
    // that fraction of the mistagged signal which, by chance, got assigned
    // the correct charge. ('Mistagged' means that the wrong track was used
    // to determine charge, but about 50% of random tracks will have the same
    // charge as the right track did.) Clearly the above can be simplified (using
    // S and S' to indicate non-flipped and flipped versions of the signal):
    // P = (p_s + p_m*l_f) S + p_m*(1-l_f) S' + p_B B
    //   = a(bS + (1-b)S') + p_B B.
    // where
    // a = p_s + p_m
    // b = (p_s + p_m*l_f) / (p_s + p_m)
    // or in other words, b is the fraction of signal + mistag that has the right
    // charge. It's up to the user to create this variable. The default is to take
    // b as 1, if 'mistag' is not supplied.
    // Note that normalisation is not affected because the integrals of S and S'
    // are identical and the weights sum to one, and efficiency is not affected
    // because it depends on the momenta of the daughter tracks, which are not
    // affected by making the wrong charge assignment to the mother.
